## :pencil2:  AirBnB clone -Web static:

This project we learn how to manipulate HTML and CSS languajes. We take the first steps to “design” / “sketch” / “prototype” each element of the front end part of our web application.  We:

+ Create simple HTML static pages
+ Use the style guide
+ But, at the moment with fake contents. That means, the data are loaded from anything.
+ We don't use Javascript, only HTML and CSS
